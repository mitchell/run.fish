# run(.fish)

This repo contains my run(.fish) script. It serves as a central place to store and document commands
related to a project. It was written with the KISS principle at the forefront of my mind. New
versions will only ever be simple enough to understand almost immediately.

In this repo is a hello world example. You can just copy this script to your repo and replace it's
command functions with your own. You're encouraged to modify it to your needs, but I urge you to
keep the KISS principle in mind as well. Shell scripts have a way of getting away from you (who
knew?).
